# ENINDU ALAHAPPERUMA

This is the source code for my personal website, written in [Laravel](https://laravel.com)â€”a framework based on [PHP](https://www.php.net). Before the launch of this website, there was a custom-built static site generator, written in [Go](https://go.dev), used to generate my personal website. For some reasons, I decided to migrate it to the Laravel framework. You can read the full article and view the technology stack from [this link](https://enindu.com/blog/the-story-of-enindu-com).
