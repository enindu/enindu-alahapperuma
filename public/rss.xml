            <link>https://enindu.com/blog/ultimate-web-development-guide-for-clients</link>
            <description><![CDATA[I come across numerous web development groups on Facebook every day. These groups are filled with people—some searching for web developers at low prices, while others are offering their services for equally low rates. This obsession with cheap work has distorted the true value of web development in recent years. The reality is, web development is not cheap at all.]]></description>

            <link>https://enindu.com/blog/understanding-http</link>
            <description><![CDATA[There are countless articles and videos on the internet explaining what HTTP is. If I were to write this post in the same way, it would just be another one among many. Instead, I'll be breaking down HTTP from the perspective of a back-end engineer, highlighting common issues developers face with it. Let's dive in.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In a previous article, I provided a high-level overview of HTTP. In this article, I will dive into the low-level implementation of HTTP, covering topics such as creating HTTP servers and even lower-level TCP servers. Discussions on HTTP and TCP clients will be reserved for a separate article. Expect plenty of code examples. So, let's get started.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This isn't just another article explaining shared hosting. Instead, I'll break it down from a system administrator's perspective—why you should never use shared hosting, even for a small web application, and what better alternatives exist. If you're looking for affordable hosting solutions, this will be a comprehensive guide, much like my previous article on web development. Let's dive in!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Most developers have a high-level understanding of DNS. However, for web developers, grasping DNS at a low level is crucial. Writing yet another article explaining DNS from a high-level perspective would be redundant. Instead, this article delves into the DNS protocol and its inner workings at a low level, offering a system administrator's perspective. Let's dive in.]]></description>
