My expertise lies in back-end programming, web development, and to a lesser extent, logo design. In regards to web development, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though I do not engage in front-end development. My focus is primarily on user experience, particularly in terms of performance, rather than aesthetics and interface design.</p><p>My primary skillset lies in back-end programming, where I utilize languages such as PHP, Go, Node.js, and Deno. While I hold a love-hate relationship with Node.js due to its reliance on JavaScript, I must acknowledge that it is a reliable library. As a result, I have opted to use Deno, a library with full TypeScript support, as an alternative. PHP, a language that is often met with disdain, is a language that I frequently utilize for enterprise-level web applications. Despite its reputation, I have found it to be a stable and well-established language. In contrast, Go, a strict-typed, compiled, functional programming language developed by Google, is the language that I hold in highest regard. Its elegant design and functionality make it the most appealing language in my toolkit.</p><p>It should be noted that I am not proficient in other programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby, or any others commonly utilized by others in the field.</p><p>In terms of personal preference, I value simplicity and minimalism. I use Arch as my operating system of choice and prefer to utilize open-source software. In regards to logo design, I primarily use Inkscape, though I also have some familiarity with GIMP. However, it is important to note that I am not a professional graphic designer.</p></figure></section><section><header><h2 id="what-is-jolly-roger"><a href="index.html#what-is-jolly-roger" title="What is Jolly Roger?">What is Jolly Roger?</a></h2></header><figure><p>The Jolly Roger is a flag that has become synonymous with piracy. It is not uncommon for individuals to adopt the Jolly Roger as their profile picture, as was my case. While there is no particular reason behind my decision to do so, I simply found the concept behind it to be appealing.</p></figure></section><section><header><h2 id="what-is-this-website"><a href="index.html#what-is-this-website" title="What is This Website?">What is This Website?</a></h2></header><figure><p>This website serves as a personal platform where I share articles and works that I have created. It is not meant to serve as a portfolio showcasing my professional achievements to the general public.</p><p>The reason for the existence of this website has a somewhat humorous origin. My name is somewhat unique in Sri Lanka, and as far as I am aware, I am the first person to bear this particular name. However, I recently discovered that there are two other individuals with the same name, which concerned me. As a result, I decided to secure this domain name in order to distinguish myself from these other individuals. Thus, this website was not initially intended to be a space for sharing articles and works with the public, but rather a means of establishing my personal identity online.</p><p>Despite its unconventional beginnings, I have found this website to be a useful outlet for sharing my writing and creative projects. The entire website is built using Go, and the HTML and CSS generated is vanilla and does not utilize any JavaScript. Out of laziness, I created a static page generator of sorts to avoid the tedious task of writing raw HTML code. All the necessary functionality was achieved using standard Go libraries, and no external libraries were utilized in the development process.</p><p>The source code for this website is available on GitHub and is licensed under the MIT license, which allows for free distribution and modification by anyone.
