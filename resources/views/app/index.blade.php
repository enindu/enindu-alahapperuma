                <h2 class="mb-0">About Me</h2>
                <h3 class="mb-0">Who Am I?</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">My name is Enindu Alahapperuma, a freelance software engineer from Sri Lanka. I specialize in back-end development, system administration, and website security, with over seven years of experience in back-end engineering. My journey began with a deep interest in Linux and open-source software, which naturally led me to system administration. Over time, I transitioned into back-end development, where I now focus on creating robust, secure, and efficient systems.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">My journey with Linux began with Ubuntu 5.04 (I still have the original CD). That was almost a decade ago. When I installed it, I knew Linux was my thing. Today, I still use a Linux distribution, specifically Arch Linux. After my Ubuntu 5.04 experience, I became a distro hopper for several years. During that time, I explored almost every major Linux distribution, including Debian, Fedora, Mint, openSUSE, Manjaro, Zorin, elementary, NixOS, Kali, Gentoo, and less popular ones like Puppy, Tiny Core, CrunchBang, Void, ArchBang, Damn Small, and even BSD distributions like OpenBSD, GhostBSD, and FreeBSD. Despite using many UNIX-like distributions, my distro hopping journey concluded with Arch Linux, which remains my preferred choice to this day.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">My extensive experience as a distro hopper has endowed me with a deep understanding of various philosophies, communities, build systems, init systems, GUIs, CLIs, kernels, and tools. This diverse knowledge base enhances my capabilities as a system administrator and security expert. Leveraging this expertise, I embarked on a career in web development, quickly gravitating towards back-end engineering. As a back-end engineer, I excel in network programming, protocols, encryption, databases, servers, cloud computing, and website security, which collectively define my professional identity.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">While I am proficient in web development, back-end engineering, and system administration, I do not consider myself a full-stack developer or a DevOps engineer. These roles are distinct and require specialized skills. In my view, the concept of a full-stack developer is often misunderstood, especially in the web development field. It implies that one can be equally skilled in both front-end and back-end development, which can lead to a lack of depth in either area. Similarly, DevOps is a unique discipline that combines development and operations practices to improve the software development lifecycle, and it should not be conflated with general development roles.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-0">I Am A Back-End Engineer</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">Before I embarked on my career as a professional back-end engineer, I started as a web developer. I have always been the curious type, constantly questioning and reasoning about the tasks I undertake. This curiosity propelled me further into the web development field, much like my journey with Linux. During my web development days, I frequently experimented with various frameworks, tools, and CMSs. I even created my own CSS frameworks, PHP frameworks, and tools to aid my development efforts early in my career. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain substantial knowledge in a short period, ultimately leading me to choose back-end development as my future career path.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Like many others, I did not choose back-end development solely for financial gain. My passion lies in understanding how systems work. I have always been more interested in the intricacies of server-side operations than in front-end development. Even with my extensive experience, my knowledge of front-end frameworks like React or Vue is minimal. My focus is on how web browsers communicate with servers, how servers process those requests, and how responses are sent back to the browsers. This is where my true interest lies.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">As a back-end engineer, I primarily work with Apache, nginx, and PHP as my enterprise-level stack. I often integrate cloud computing technologies to optimize the applications I build. Despite my focus on back-end engineering, I continue to develop websites as a freelance web developer. To create robust websites, I exclusively use Laravel as my framework of choice. Laravel is an excellent framework that allows for rapid application development. I prefer not to use CMS platforms like WordPress or Drupal, as they tend to be heavier and do not always adhere to certain standards. Laravel, while not the lightest framework, offers a balance of performance and adherence to best practices that I find essential for my projects.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">The Go language is my preferred language for network programming. Compared to PHP, Go is more low-level and does not run within Apache or nginx. I also use Go to build day-to-day CLI programs, which you can find on my GitHub profile. Go is a simple yet powerful language, especially for network programming. It allows for easy manipulation of protocols and offers a comprehensive standard library that includes I/O tools, operating system tools, database tools, encoding tools, hashing tools, lower-level networking tools, and higher-level HTTP tools. Go's concurrency model makes it excellent for back-end engineering, particularly in performance-critical applications. Additionally, Go is a strictly typed, procedural programming language. Despite its simplicity, Go's syntax and features make it my first choice for many projects.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">In addition to PHP and Go, I also have hands-on experience with Node.js. Although JavaScript is not my preferred language, I appreciate Node.js for its non-blocking nature, which makes it an excellent choice for I/O programming. This characteristic allows for efficient handling of I/O operations, making Node.js my go-to library for such tasks.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-0">I Am A System Administrator</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">Even though my primary profession is back-end engineering, my true passion lies in system administration, as it was the foundation of my career. I am a highly capable Linux system administrator with extensive experience in various build systems and tools. Due to my back-end expertise, I handle LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) stacks daily. Additionally, I manage operating systems, networks, firewalls, and servers. I am responsible for their installation, maintenance, monitoring, and troubleshooting.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">When it comes to operating systems, my expertise lies primarily in Linux, which encompasses a vast array of knowledge. Although I have hands-on experience with BSD and Windows, I do not consider myself an expert in these systems. My experience spans various Linux distributions, including Debian and NixOS, and different init systems like those used in Arch Linux and Void. I have worked with diverse toolsets such as Ubuntu and Kali, and environments ranging from GUIs like KDE and GNOME to CLIs. Additionally, I am proficient with different package managers, including pacman and dnf. This extensive experience has endowed me with expertise in operating system management, covering day-to-day tasks, monitoring, analysis, and user management. I also manage SSH servers, VNC servers, and RDP servers.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Throughout my career, I have managed hundreds of HTTP servers and mail servers such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 servers, which has honed my skills as a system administrator in the web hosting domain. Proficiency in managing HTTP servers requires a deep understanding of DNS, TLS, proxies, cron jobs, version control, and log analysis. My expertise in web development, back-end development, and network programming has made me a true expert in system administration within this area.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">In addition to managing HTTP servers and mail servers, I also create and maintain low-level TCP, UDP, and UNIX servers through network programming. My expertise as a system administrator extends to various types of servers, and I enjoy exploring low-level networking concepts in my free time. I have a deep understanding of how these protocols work and how clients should respond to them. Additionally, I possess some knowledge of banking servers, their protocols, and standards.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">In addition to back-end engineering and general system administration, I also possess knowledge in cloud computing. Early in my career, I utilized cloud computing to enhance my web applications. With experience and my natural system administration skills, I soon became proficient in cloud computing system administration as well. I primarily use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my cloud service provider due to its stability and reliability. Besides AWS, I also have hands-on experience with DigitalOcean and Google Cloud. Today, I offer comprehensive system administration services on any cloud platform. However, it is important to note that my services are distinct from DevOps; I focus solely on system administration, which is different from DevOps practices.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-0">I Am A Website Security Expert</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">Over time, my experience in web development, back-end engineering, and system administration has honed my skills as a website security expert. It is my responsibility to stay vigilant against any potential threats while performing web development, back-end development, or system administration tasks. This constant vigilance has enabled me to become proficient in website security. Leveraging my extensive knowledge of various systems and practices, I effectively manage security at the operating system, network, and application levels.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">To ensure robust security, I employ several practices such as patching operating system vulnerabilities, consistently updating to the latest versions, adhering to best practices and standards, and managing TLS certificates. Additionally, I utilize various tools to scan for vulnerabilities, including port scanning tools, network scanning tools, and website scanning tools. As a security expert, I believe that no system is 100% secure; every system has potential vulnerabilities that we may not yet be aware of. It is our responsibility to remain vigilant and proactive. With my extensive experience, I strive to maintain the highest level of security.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-0">I Am A Freelancer</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">With all the experience I mentioned above, I now offer my services to the public as a freelancer in web development and system administration.

                <h3 class="mb-0">Version History</h3>
                <p class="mb-0">This is the 4th version of this website. The first two versions were built using a custom static site generation tool written in Go. Due to various reasons, I migrated to Laravel in the 3rd version. In this 4th version, I have updated the Laravel framework to its latest version and made several front-end improvements to enhance the user experience.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">In this version of the website, I continue to use a technology stack that includes plain HTML, Halfmoon as my CSS framework, and Laravel as my PHP framework. Although the website itself does not require a database for its operations, Laravel utilizes SQLite for its database needs. The website is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance and served through an Apache HTTP server. Cloudflare is integrated as a reverse proxy server to enhance security and performance. Origin to proxy DNS management is handled via AWS Route 53 and proxy to client DNS management is handled via Cloudflare.</p>
