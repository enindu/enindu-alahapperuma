        <p>If you wish to communicate with me for any reason, you may do so by sending an email to <a href="mailto:enindu@gmail.com" title="Email Me">enindu@gmail.com</a>. In the interest of simplicity, I have chosen not to implement a traditional contact form on this website. This decision is also motivated by a desire to avoid receiving spam emails.</p>
