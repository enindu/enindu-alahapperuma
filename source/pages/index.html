  <main>
    <p>I am Enindu Alahapperuma, a back-end developer from Sri Lanka. I do back-end programming, web development and a little bit of logo designing. As a web developer, I know HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I do not design or develop front-end. For the record, I do not like front-end and JavaScript. I only concerned about UX, not UI.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My core strength is back-end. I do back-end programming with PHP, Go, Node.js and Deno. I do not like Node.js much, because of JavaScript, but I must admit that, it is a good library after all. Because of that love-hate relationship, I choose Deno over Node.js, a decent library with full TypeScript support, out-of-the-box. On the other hand, PHP is the most hated language on the planet. Here I am, still using PHP. I mostly use PHP for enterprise-level web applications. It is solid as a rock and matured like a fine whiskey bottle. If you know how to write PHP, you know PHP. If you are concerned, I know Laravel, but I do not like it. And last, not least, Go, a strict-typed, compiled, functional, general-purpose programming language from Google, is the most elegant language across the all languages I use. I just love it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the record, I do not know C or C++ or C# or Java or Python or Ruby or any other programming language as most people do.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I like simplicity. (I use Arch, by the way) Simplicity is not what most people think of. Simplicity is the low-level. I do not like to be bloated. I know, what I know. I will know, what I want to know. I do not know everything.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I use Linux and do not know Windows or MacOS or BSD. For the record, I use open source software only. I also do a little bit of logo designing. For that i use Inkscape mostly. And I also know GIMP, a little bit. But, I am not a graphic designer.</p>

    <p>Jolly Roger is the flag of pirates. There is no specific reason to use Jolly Roger as my profile picture. I just like the idea behind it.</p>

  <main>
    <p>This is my personal website. I post articles and works here. But this is not a portfolio website that, I share my works with the public.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There is a story behind this website. My name is kinda unique one in Sri Lanka. As far as I know, I am the first person, who named after this name. I recently found these two people with my name and I am very concerned about it. So I decided to take this domain. That is the true reason behind this website. It is not about sharing articles or my works with the public in the first place.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After all, here I am writing articles and sharing works.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This entire website is written in Go and compiled into vanilla HTML and CSS. There is no JavaScript magic here. I was too lazy to write HTML codes, so I created this static page generator (Kinda). I did not used any external libraries to create this. Everything depends on standard Go libraries.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Since the content of these pages are rendered across the entire screen, there is an accessibility issue, for sure. Who cares. Accessibility is for dummies.</p>
